# Anipix

A web-app that generates images with quotes by anime characters with an anime character background.

**Also, wrote my own multipart form-data parser myself for this project, cuz why not? ðŸ˜†**

(Disclaimer: not to be used in production environment, it got flaws.)

[Check the demo here](https://anipix.ruw.sh)

## Why?

Needed a project to experiment aroun with `app` directory routing of the new Next.js 13. And, Todo Lists are not a fun project. So, thought of something which i thought would be interesting.

_Also, along the way thought of manually parsing multipart form-data by myself to get a little more deeper understanding of how things work._

Planning to add user accounts, to allow saving generated images if I feel like it, lol.

## Other Techs Used

- Tailwind - for design system
- sharp - for image manipulation and composition
